# Numerical-simulation-of-NLSE-Non-Linear_Scrodinger_Equation

Non-Linear Schrodinger equation is an appromixation for (slow) pulse propagation of light in fibers. It takes into account the dispersion relation (Group Velocity Dispersion-GVD) and the third order nonlinear effect (Self-Phase Modulation-SPM in the most general case). NLSE can be written as -  

$\frac{\partial A}{\partial z} = - \frac{\iota \beta_2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial \tau ^2} + \iota \gamma |A|^2 A$
